## Development

- The game is developed using Unity and C#
- Features custom shaders, 30+ original sprites, 4 original music tracks, and more

During the development, I had the opportunity to dive into several new areas of game development. Here are some of the key things I learned:

- 2D Shaders: I created custom shaders to enhance the game's visual effects and atmosphere.
- 2D Lighting: I implemented 2D lighting to set the mood, casting shadows and highlighting key elements in the maze.
- Making Cutscenes: I used Unity’s Timeline and Cinemachine to create dynamic cutscenes that added narrative depth to the game.
